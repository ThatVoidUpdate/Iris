# Iris

Iris is a viewer for Nasa-format IMG files. Current compatibility is limited, however more versions are 
planned to be added in the future

Image files can be downloaded from here: https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/data/

Supported missions:
* Cassini
* Voyager

IMG files can either be loaded through the menu, or by dragging them directly onto the window.
